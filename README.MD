 (2) Retrieving all notifications for a users
 (3) retrieving new user notifications during the session
 
 ### Integration and unit tests are also added to the application. The integration test will need the DB to be ready with the seed data and a user-id to be provided as input. Seed data are provided.
 
 ### A signalR hub is added to API for the displaying of new Notifications. A test console is added in order to test the SignalR messaging. To test the SignalR, the DB should be available with Seed Data. And a user-Id added as input parameter.
 
### A test can also be done with Swagger which is the Start page of the API.
